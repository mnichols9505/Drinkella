        We are a small company that just thought one day that people need
        our Drinkella in their lives. Now a days, everyone walks in the
        rain and has that one thought: I'm thirsty now and I sure wish I could drink the
        rain water. Here at AM2 we listen to those thoughts and thus Drinkella was born.

        Our team here in AM2 has come from all over the US and meet up in Salt
        Lake City, Utah. This is where we all attended the same college. We all became
        fast friends and decided this was a really good idea to pursuit, and we
        needed to make it for the people that just would die in order to fulfill the urge
        to drink rain water.
