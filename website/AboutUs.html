        We are a small company that just thought one day that people need
        our Drinkella in their lives because everyone is walking in the
        rain and has the thought, im thirsty now I wish i could drink the
        rain water and the thus the Drinkella was born.

        We are all from different places in the US and meet up in Salt
        Lake City, Utah where we all attended the same collage. We became
        fast friends and decided this was a really good idea and we
        needed to make it for the people that just want to fill the urge
        to drink rain water.
